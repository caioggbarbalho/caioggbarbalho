<h1 align="left">Hello there, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaueMarques/kaueMarques/master/hi.gif" height="30px">I'm Caio Barbalho</h1>

- 👋 I'm a 25yo brazilian developer going through my second college degree
  - Currently in my second semester of System Analysis and Development
  - Also a B.A in Cinema (or Film, but Cinema sounds cooler 😎)
    
      - Can we just all agree that translating degrees and such is kinda wack? 

<br>

- 🔭 I’m currently studying **Node.js**
  
- 👨‍💻 Knowledgeable about **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**

<br>

- 💬 I'm preeeetty good at this english thingy (EF Level 16 ­ Upper Advanced ­ CEFR Level C2)
    - I speak spanish (B2) as well and my native language is portuguese
 
- 🗣️ My years in Film made me a conflict-resolving, peacekeeping, ✨ *master communicator* ✨ 
  - I mean, just saying, I'm a good team player 👍

 <br>
 
- 🔥 Hot Take: LOST is the best goddamn series in this whole world and I'll fight you about it

- 🎲 Fun fact: I'm a die-hard TTRPG fan, watched all of Critical Role and DM for about 7 years now
